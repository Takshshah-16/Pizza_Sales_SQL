# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analytics - SQL Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze a pizza sales dataset using **MySQL Workbench** to derive valuable business insights. By writing optimized SQL queries, I explored key sales metrics, customer ordering patterns, and revenue trends. This project demonstrates my proficiency in **SQL querying, data aggregation, joins, and analytical functions**.

## 🔍 Dataset
The dataset consists of multiple tables related to pizza sales, including **orders, pizzas, and categories**. These tables were joined and analyzed to extract meaningful insights.
All the datasets requied for this project have been uploaded in the repository.

## 🏆 Key Objectives & SQL Queries
### 🔹 Basic Analysis
1. **Retrieve the total number of orders placed**.
2. **Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.**
3. **Identify the highest-priced pizza.**
4. **Identify the most common pizza size ordered.**
5. **List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.**

### 🔹 Intermediate Analysis
6.**Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.**
7.**Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.**
8.**Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.**
9.**Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.**
10.**Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.**


### 🔹 Advanced Analysis
11.**Calculate the percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue.**
12.**Analyze the cumulative revenue generated over time.**
13.**Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each pizza category.**
