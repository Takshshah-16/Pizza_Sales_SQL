# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analytics - SQL Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze a pizza sales dataset using **MySQL Workbench** to derive valuable business insights. By writing optimized SQL queries, I explored key sales metrics, customer ordering patterns, and revenue trends. This project demonstrates my proficiency in **SQL querying, data aggregation, joins, and analytical functions**.

## 🔍 Dataset
The dataset consists of multiple tables related to pizza sales, including **orders, pizzas, and categories**. These tables were joined and analyzed to extract meaningful insights.
Dataset 1

## 🏆 Key Objectives & SQL Queries
### 🔹 Basic Analysis
1. **Total Number of Orders**: Counted the total orders placed.
2. **Total Revenue**: Calculated the sum of all pizza sales.
3. **Highest-Priced Pizza**: Identified the most expensive pizza in the dataset.
4. **Most Commonly Ordered Pizza Size**: Determined the most frequently ordered pizza size.
5. **Top 5 Most Ordered Pizza Types**: Retrieved the most popular pizzas along with their order quantities.

### 🔹 Intermediate Analysis
6. **Total Quantity of Each Pizza Category Ordered**: Used joins to summarize total sales per category.
7. **Distribution of Orders by Hour**: Extracted the ordering trend across different hours of the day.
8. **Category-wise Distribution of Pizzas**: Grouped and categorized pizza sales data.
9. **Average Number of Pizzas Ordered per Day**: Analyzed the ordering patterns over time.
10. **Top 3 Most Ordered Pizza Types by Revenue**: Identified high-revenue pizza types.

### 🔹 Advanced Analysis
11. **Percentage Contribution of Each Pizza Type to Total Revenue**: Calculated revenue share for each pizza.
12. **Cumulative Revenue Over Time**: Tracked revenue growth across the dataset's timeline.
13. **Top 3 Most Ordered Pizza Types by Revenue for Each Category**: Combined category-wise and revenue-based insights.
